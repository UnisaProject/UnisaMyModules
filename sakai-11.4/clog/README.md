CLOG (Collaborative Log)

A blog like tool for the Sakai platform.

Documentation will be maintained, as now, at https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/CLOG, but issues will
be maintained in Github.

(There is still a copy of CLOG's code in Sakai SVN for the time being https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/clog/, but will not be updated.)
