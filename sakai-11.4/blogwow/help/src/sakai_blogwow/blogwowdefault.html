<h2>BlogWow!: Help</h2>

<h3>What is a blog?</h3>
<p>A blog is an online journal, in which individuals can write entries, ordered by date, which they can share with others. Members of the site can comment on each others’ entries.</p>

<h3>Using a blog in teaching</h3>

<p>A blog can make a interesting learning diary, with students keeping a journal of what they have learnt, and what they would like to find out more about. Some students find that this can offer a useful opportunity to reflect on their own learning. If they choose, students can restrict individual blog entries so that they are only visible to teaching staff and themselves. Blog entries can also be made visible to all the other students in the site, or to the public.</p>
<p>Blogs can be particularly useful if students are working on individual projects, and you want them to be able to follow what the other students in their group are doing. Students can be asked to blog regularly, and to read each others’ blogs. Students writing dissertations can be asked to blog to keep their research supervisor informed of progress.</p>

<h3>Using a blog in collaboration sites</h3>

<p>A blog can also be very helpful for researchers working on a collaborative project. Individual researchers can use it as a research diary, jotting down their findings so far, and reading entries by their colleagues.</p>
<p>Alternatively, research participants can be asked to blog about their experiences, providing a secure and permanent record of the research project. Again, people can can restrict individual blog entries so that they are only visible to the site administrators and themselves. By default, all blog entries are visible to the other site participants.</p>

<h3>The blog tool in Sakai</h3>

<p>The blog tool in Sakai works on a site by site basis – entries that people write in one site will not appear in any other sites.</p>
<p>People will not be automatically notified by email about comments on their blogs, or about new entries in other people’s blogs.</p>
<p>Blog entries do not display in the ‘Recent Activity’ tool on the home page of your site.</p>
<p>Blog entries can be searched by the Search tool in Sakai.</p>

<h2>Reading and commenting on blogs</h2>

<h3>Reading blog entries</h3>

<p>To read someone’s blog, go to the ‘all the blogs’ page. This is the home page for the tool. You can see this page by clicking the ‘all the blogs’ link in the actions bar.</p>
<p>Your own blog is linked to at the top of the page.</p>
<p>All the other members of the site are listed below.</p>
<p>If you would like to see who blogged most recently,  click on the ‘last updated’ heading. The blogs will be displayed with the most recent entries first.</p>
<p>Click the name of the person whose blog you would like to read.</p>
<p>You will see all this person’s blog entries, with the most recent entry at the top of the page.</p>
<p>If there are any comments on a entry, you will be able to read them by clicking on the ‘comments’ link below the entry.  This will display all the comments on this blog entry.</p>

<p>Enter your profile description in the text box. You can format the text using the icons above the text box.</p>

Get the web address (URL) of the photo. (You can do this by clicking on ‘edit details’ link for the photo once you have uploaded it; the web address will be displayed at the bottom of the page.)  </p>

<p>Click ‘change settings’ to save your profile and picture.</p>
<p>Note that your blog profile is not the same as your standard Sakai profile.</p>
