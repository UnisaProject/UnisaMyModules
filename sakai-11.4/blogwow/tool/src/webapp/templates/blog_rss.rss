        <![CDATA[<p>There is a good chance I might by a Dell sometime this summer now that they 
        are shipping systems with Ubuntu Linux and all the hardware configured.</p>
        <p>Despite that awesome news, the Ubuntu section of their website also fixes the problem with 
        it being incredibly difficult to actually purchase things from their website.  There are 3 
        boxes (2 desktops and 1 laptop) that ship with Ubuntu and it&#8217;s pretty quick to select 
        one and configure it, unlike the sprawling mess of models on the default Dell website.  This 
        has always been the highlight of using Apple&#8217;s Online Store, you can actually find a 
        model and configure it.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&#038;cs=19&#038;l=en&#038;s=dhs">Dell Ubuntu Models</a><br />
        They seem pretty reasonably priced too.
