<h2>Add More Pages at Top Level (Left Margin) </h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function appears on top-level pages only (a page in the
left margin.) You may add pages to other pages using the "Add Subpage"
function.</p>

<p> "Add More Pages" allows you to create one or more new pages which will be added
to the left margin. You can also choose an existing page, even one
that has been deleted.

<p>Use the "More Tools" pull-down and choose <strong>Add More Pages</strong>.</p>

<p> You may create several pages at once, as long as the names follow
a numerical pattern. E.g. if you specify a name of "Page 2" and ask for
3 pages, you will get "Page 2," "Page 3," and Page 4.</p>

<p> If you check "Make new pages copies of the current one (except that subpages are omitted)", then the new page is
a copy of the current one. Otherwise it's a new (blank) page. When pages are copied, subpages are omitted.</p>

<p> Use <strong>Put Existing Page in the Left Margin</strong> to use a existing page. This can be used to restore
top-level pages that were accidentally deleted, or to put existing subpages in the left margin.
