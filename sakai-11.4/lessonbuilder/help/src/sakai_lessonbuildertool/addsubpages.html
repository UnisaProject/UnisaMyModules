<h2>Adding Additional Pages</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<h4><a name="7">Add Subpages</a></h4>
<p>Lessons pages can refer to other pages. Since pages are commonly organized as a hierarchy, Lessons refers pages
referenced in another page as "subpages" of it.</p>

<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Add Subpage</strong>.
Fill in the text field labeled <em>Page title</em> with the title of your new subpage and click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>

<p>This will take you to a blank Lessons page, where you can add new content pieces as you see fit.</p>

<p>Alternatively, rather than filling in a title, click "Choose Existing Page." That will let you include an existing subpage
in a second location, or restore a deleted page. NOTE: if you include the same subpage in more than one place, there is just
one copy of the page. If you make changes on the page, the change will appear at all locations.</p>

<h5> Less common ways to use pages </h5>

<p> The term "subpage"  can be somewhat misleading, since it's prefectly possible for the same page to be referred from from several
other pages. It's also possible to have a sequence of pages where each is really the next page in the sequence, rather than 
a subpage. It's even possible for pages to refer to each other, producing a loop, though we don't recommend doing this.</p>

<p> Add subpage is still the way to set this up. Normally it creates a new page, and puts a link to it on the original
page. That is, it creates a new subpage. However there is also an option for choosing an existing page.
That lets you add a reference to an existing page. This is the way to make the same page appear on more
than one other page.

<p> <strong> Next page </strong> The Add Page dialog has an option that's worth explaining: "Next page." Normally Lessons treats
pages that appear on another page as "subpages." The navigation at the top of the page will show that
you've gone down another level, and give you an easy way to return. But if you're constructing a 
sequence of pages, you probably don't want Lessons to treat them as subpages. That is, you want the
navigation at the top to treat them as at the same level, not adding another level to the "bread crumbs",
but displaying the next and previous pages in the sequence using the Next and Previous links at the top.
To do this, when you create or add a reference to the next page in the sequence, choose the "Next page"
option.<p>

<h5><a name="7.1"> Edit a Subpage</a></h5> 

<p>To edit information about a subpage, click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the subpage you would like to modify.</p> 

<p>The options available for modification are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Item Name</strong> - Change the name of the text of the link to your subpage on the main Lessons page.</li>
  <li><strong>Item Description</strong> - Change/add a description to the subpage, which will appear beneath the link to the subpage.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Page</strong> - Change the subpage being linked to.</li>
  <li><strong>Next page, i.e. page replaces the current one rather than returning to the current one.</strong> This is explained above.</li>
  <li><strong>Show as button rather than link</strong></li> - This is a cosmetic option to have your subpage appear as a button rather than a link in your Lessons plan.
  <li><strong>Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed</strong> - Select this option if you would like it to appear/be accessible only after previously 'Required' items have been completed/accessed.</li>
  <li><strong>Require This Item </strong>- Select this option to make this item a 'Required' item for later on in the Lessons plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the groups for which this item should be shown </strong> - If you have groups or sections in the site, allows you to make this
page visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.

</ul>

<p>To save your changes, click <strong>Update Item</strong>. To remove the subpage from your page, click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
