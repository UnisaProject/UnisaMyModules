<h2>Import Content From a ZIP file</h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to load a file in ZIP format. Many authoring tools
intended for instructors can export in ZIP format. Sakai has special support
for ZIP files produced by Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate, but any ZIP
file should work.</p>

<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Upload Content in ZIP File</strong>.</p> 

<p> Where possible, Lessons will add a link to the content you
have just uploaded. For this to work, we must be able to identify a 
particular file from the upload that is the "starting point."
The code can recognize this for certain common formats, including
Camtasia, Wimba Create, and Articulate. For other files, we will use index.html
or index.htm if it exists.</p>

<p> The file contained in the ZIP file are loaded into a new folder in Resources.</p>

<p> The "Upload Content in a ZIP File" dialog allows you to specify a file. If you do it will 
be uploaded and processed. However you can also choose a ZIP file is already
present in the Resources tool. If you do that, Lessons will read the ZIP archive,
extract all files in it, and add them as if you had uploaded the ZIP file.</p>

<p> This function depends upon features in the Sakai kernel. It may not appear for
older versions of Sakai. </p>
