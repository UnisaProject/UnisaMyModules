<h2>Add text or HTML content ot a page </h2>

<a name="top"> </a>

<p> This function allows you to add a block of text to your page. You
can also use it to add other web content, such as tables or links.
However it is often more convenient to use "Add Resources" to add
links to the page.</p>

<h4><a name="2">Add Text</a></h4>	
			
<p>Use the "Add Content" pull-down and choose <strong>Add Text</strong>. Enter your text in the rich text editor provided and click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p class="note">You can use text to introduce other pieces of content on the page, this can help orient the student.</p>

<p> If you have groups or sections in the site, a set of checkboxes will be shown under the rich text editor.
This allows you to make this text visible only to some groups. Students who are not in one of the checked sections of groups will not see this item on their page at all.</li>

<h5><a name="2.1">Edit Text</a></h5>

<p>If you want to edit a piece of text that you have already added to the page, click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the text item. When you are satisfied with your changes, click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page. You can also click <strong>Cancel</strong> to return to your page without applying any changes.</p>

<h5><a name="2.2">Remove Text</a></h5>

<p>If you want to remove a piece of text, click <strong>Edit</strong> to the left of the text item. Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button below the text editor.</p> 
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> There is no confirmation step; clicking the delete button will permanently remove the text item from your Lesson Builder page. There is no way to retrieve it once it has been deleted.</p>

<h5>Allowable content</h5>

<p> To prevent users from adding content that might cause problems for other users, Sakai provides ways of
avoiding "dangerous" content. Javascript code is considered dangerous. Even embedding content from other
sites may be considered dangerous.</p>

<p> Normally the instructor can embed content from other sites. Whether or not they can use Javascript is
controlled by institutional policy. </p>

<p> Student-supplied content is more restrictive. Students are never permitted to add Javascript or other
dangerous content. </p>
