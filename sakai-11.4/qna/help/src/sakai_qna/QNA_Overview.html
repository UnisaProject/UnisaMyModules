<h2>Questions and Answers: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>This tool allows members of a site to interact with each other by privately or publicly asking questions and receiving answers.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>
<p>The level of interactivity can be adjusted so that the tool can function as a static question bank, with questions and the answers provided by the site owner, or as a dynamic space in which site members can ask and even answer each others' questions. In the case of the latter, new questions can be moderated so that they don't appear on the site immediately, and then replied to privately or published.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<p>If it is necessary or beneficial to conceal the identity those asking questions, select the anonymous setting in the tool options.</p>
