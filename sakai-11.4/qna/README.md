Contrib: QNA (Questions and Answers)

## Description:
QNA (Questions and Answers) is a new tool being developed by UNISA and UCT. QNA enables students to ask questions anonymously, which can be answered by other students or lecturers or tutors (instructors/TAs). Questions are ranked by their popularity and can also be organized into categories. QNA builds on experiences from two existing tools: UNISA's FAQ tool and UCT's DFAQ tool.
